                            She established the habitation of hope which is the
                            home for rehabilitation of boys taken off the
                            streets and to give them a future and a hope in
                            Christ. These children, who lived and slept on the
                            beach, were involved in petty armed robbery, sale
                            and use of drugs. In addition to the academic
                            education, the school also gives vocational training
                            in basket weaving, artwork, and music. Having
                            achieved all these for God, no wonder God gave her
                            the mandate to establish the Feast of Esther.
